# hello-world

Hello All,

I'm new to coding and I'm teaching myself how to do so. I'm using various online resources to learn such as "Automate The Boring Stuff", Codeacademy.com, codewars.com, and hackthissite.org. I have only been learning for a couple of months now but look forward to learning and growing as a programmer.
